In this study, we aim to describe the recent CRC incidence and mortality patterns and trends linking the findings to the prospects of reducing the burden through cancer prevention and care.                                         Design                                Estimates of sex-specific CRC incidence and mortality rates in 2012 were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database. Temporal patterns were assessed for 37 countries using data from                 Cancer Incidence in Five Continents                 (CI5) volumes I--X and the WHO mortality database. Trends were assessed via the annual percentage change using joinpoint regression and discussed in relation to human development levels.                                                        Results               CRC incidence and mortality rates vary up to 10-fold worldwide, with distinct gradients across human development levels, pointing towards widening disparities and an increasing burden in countries in transition. Generally, CRC incidence and mortality rates are still rising rapidly in many low-income and middle-income countries; stabilising or decreasing trends tend to be seen in highly developed countries where rates remain among the highest in the world.                                         Conclusions               Patterns and trends in CRC incidence and mortality correlate with present human development levels and their incremental changes might reflect the adoption of more western lifestyles. Targeted resource-dependent interventions, including primary prevention in low-income, supplemented with early detection in high-income settings, are needed to reduce the number of patients with CRC in future decades.},

Objective               To identify factors associated with receipt of ICIs and associated survival outcomes among patients with mCRC in routine clinical practice.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               This population-based cohort study used deidentified data from a nationwide electronic health record--derived database to include 18\,932 patients diagnosed with mCRC between January 2013 and June 2019. Population-based patients were diagnosed with de novo mCRC and had at least 2 documented clinical visits on or after the date of diagnosis. The study analyses were performed between September 2020 and April 2021.                                         Exposure               Patients received ICI therapy and/or chemotherapy as part of a systemic treatment for mCRC.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               The outcomes were receipt of ICI therapy, overall survival (OS), and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD).                                         Results                                In this cohort study of 18\,932 patients diagnosed with mCRC (10\,537 [55.7\%] male; 546 [2.9\%] Asian, 2005 [10.6\%] Black or African American, 1674 [8.8\%] Hispanic, 12\,338 [65.2\%] White, 4043 [21.4\%] unknown race or ethnicity; median [IQR] age at metastatic diagnosis, 64.6 [55.0-73.3] years), patients with MSI-H tumors had a significantly higher probability of receiving ICIs than those with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors (odds ratio [OR], 22.66 [95\% CI, 17.30-29.73];                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001), whereas patients initially diagnosed with synchronous mCRC had significantly lower odds of receiving ICIs than patients with metachronous mCRC (OR, 0.57 [95\% CI, 0.45-0.73];                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001). Patients with MSI-H tumors who received ICIs as first line of therapy had significantly longer OS than those receiving chemotherapy only (HR, 0.37 [95\% CI, 0.25-0.56];                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001). Among patients with MSS tumors, ICI-based therapy was associated with significantly longer OS for patients with high albumin level (vs low: HR, 0.28 [95\% CI, 0.18-0.45];                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001) and antibiotic use (vs nonuse: HR, 0.43 [95\% CI, 0.27-0.67];                 P                 \,\&amp;lt;\,.001), but a significantly shorter OS for patients with synchronous mCRC (vs metachronous: HR, 1.90 [95\% CI, 1.24-2.89];                 P                 \,=\,.003). In addition, 29 out of 235 patients with MSS tumors (12.3\%) experienced durable responses on ICI-based therapy. Similar patterns of associations with TTD were observed.                                                        Conclusions and Relevance               In this cohort study of patients with mCRC, clinical characteristics were associated with different survival outcomes in patients treated with ICI-based therapy, with important clinical implications for patients with MSS tumors who are generally unresponsive to immunotherapy.},

  abstract   = {SUMMARY             The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses --- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Tumor heterogeneity has been postulated as a hallmark of treatment resistance and a cure constraint in cancer patients. Conventional quantitative medical imaging (radiomics) can be extended to computing voxel-wise features and aggregating tumor subregions with similar radiological phenotypes (imaging habitats) to elucidate the distribution of tumor heterogeneity within and among tumors. Despite the promising applications of imaging habitats, they may be affected by variability of radiomics features, preventing comparison and generalization of imaging habitats techniques. We performed a comprehensive repeatability and reproducibility analysis of voxel-wise radiomics features in more than 500 lung cancer patients with computed tomography (CT) images and demonstrated the effect of voxel-wise radiomics variability on imaging habitats computation in 30 lung cancer patients with test--retest images. Repeatable voxel-wise features characterized texture heterogeneity and were reproducible regardless of the applied feature extraction parameters. Imaging habitats computed using robust radiomics features were more stable than those computed using all features in test--retest CTs from the same patient. Nine voxel-wise radiomics features (joint energy, joint entropy, sum entropy, maximum probability, difference entropy, Imc1, Imc2, Idn and Idmn) were repeatable and reproducible. This supports their application for computing imaging habitats in lung tumors towards the discovery of previously unseen tumor heterogeneity and the development of novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers for precision medicine.},

  abstract  = {AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.},

The estimates suggest that approximately one in five men or women develop cancer in a lifetime, whereas around one in nine men and one in 12 women die from it. Lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed cancer in 2022, responsible for almost 2.5 million new cases, or one in eight cancers worldwide (12.4\% of all cancers globally), followed by cancers of the female breast (11.6\%), colorectum (9.6\%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (4.9\%). Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18.7\%), followed by colorectal (9.3\%), liver (7.8\%), female breast (6.9\%), and stomach (6.8\%) cancers. Breast cancer and lung cancer were the most frequent cancers in women and men, respectively (both cases and deaths). Incidence rates (including NMSC) varied from four-fold to five-fold across world regions, from over 500 in Australia/New Zealand (507.9 per 100,000) to under 100 in Western Africa (97.1 per 100,000) among men, and from over 400 in Australia/New Zealand (410.5 per 100,000) to close to 100 in South-Central Asia (103.3 per 100,000) among women. The authors examine the geographic variability across 20 world regions for the 10 leading cancer types, discussing recent trends, the underlying determinants, and the prospects for global cancer prevention and control. With demographics-based predictions indicating that the number of new cases of cancer will reach 35 million by 2050, investments in prevention, including the targeting of key risk factors for cancer (including smoking, overweight and obesity, and infection), could avert millions of future cancer diagnoses and save many lives worldwide, bringing huge economic as well as societal dividends to countries over the forthcoming decades.},

Here, we analyzed patterns of metastatic progression across 16 major cancer types in a cohort of 1008 patients with metastatic cancer autopsied between 2000 and 2013 to assess cancer specific progression patterns of disease and related risk predictions. The frequency and location of metastases were evaluated in and across 1) 16 major cancers, 2) smoking- and non-smoking-related cancers and 3) adeno- and squamous cell carcinoma. Associations between primary and secondary sites were analyzed by the fractional and the relative risk methods. We detected significantly different cancer specific patterns of metastatic progression with specific relative risk profiles for secondary site involvement. Histology and smoking etiology influenced these patterns. Backward analysis showed that metastatic patterns help to predict unknown primary sites. Solid malignancies maintain a unique and recurrent organ tropism to specific secondary sites which does not appear to be strongly influenced by advances in cancer medicine as shown by comparison with previous data sets. The delineated landscape of metastatic progression patterns is a comprehensive data resource to both clinical and basic scientists which aids fostering new hypotheses for cancer research and cancer therapies.},

  abstract = {Obtaining frozen sections of bone tissue for intraoperative examination is challenging. To identify the bony edge of resection, orthopaedic oncologists therefore rely on pre-operative X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, these techniques do not allow for accurate diagnosis or for intraoperative confirmation of the tumour margins, and in bony sarcomas, they can lead to bone margins up to 10-fold wider (1,000-fold volumetrically) than necessary. Here, we show that real-time three-dimensional contour-scanning of tissue via ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy in reflection mode can be used to intraoperatively evaluate undecalcified and decalcified thick bone specimens, without the need for tissue sectioning. We validate the technique with gold-standard haematoxylin-and-eosin histology images acquired via a traditional optical microscope, and also show that an unsupervised generative adversarial network can virtually stain the ultraviolet-photoacoustic-microscopy images, allowing pathologists to readily identify cancerous features. Label-free and slide-free histology via ultraviolet photoacoustic microscopy may allow for rapid diagnoses of bone-tissue pathologies and aid the intraoperative determination of tumour margins.}

To address this issue, a novel approach has been developed that combines MR diffusion imaging with multispectral (MS) analysis to quantify tumor tissue populations. K-means (KM) clustering of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC),               T               2               , and proton density (               M               0               ) was employed to estimate the volumes of viable tumor tissue, necrosis, and neighboring subcutaneous adipose tissue in a human colorectal tumor xenograft mouse model. In a second set of experiments, the temporal evolution of the MS tissue classes in response to therapeutic intervention Apo2L/TRAIL and CPT-11 was observed. The multiple parameters played complementary roles in identifying the various tissues. The ADC was the dominant parameter for identifying regions of necrosis, whereas               T               2               identified two necrotic subpopulations, and               M               0               contributed to the differentiation of viable tumor from subcutaneous adipose tissue. MS viable tumor estimates (mean volume = 275 \textpm{} 147 mm               3               ) were highly correlated (r = 0.81,               P               {$<$} 0.01) with histological estimates (117 \textpm{} 51 mm               3               ). In the treatment study, MS viable tumor volume (at day 10) was 77 \textpm{} 67 mm               3               for the Apo2L/TRAIL+CPT-11 group, and was significantly reduced relative to the control group (292 \textpm{} 127 mm               3               ,               P               {$<$} 0.01).

Building on new mechanistic insights emerging from recent research, we offer our perspective on the metastatic process and reflect on possible paths of future exploration. We suggest that metastasis can be portrayed as a two-phase process: The first phase involves the physical translocation of a cancer cell to a distant organ, whereas the second encompasses the ability of the cancer cell to develop into a metastatic lesion at that distant site. Although much remains to be learned about the second phase, we feel that an understanding of the first phase is now within sight, due in part to a better understanding of how cancer cell behavior can be modified by a cell-biological program called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.},

  abstract  = {The response of colorectal adenocarcinoma liver metastases to perioperative chemotherapy can be assessed histologically in partial hepatectomy specimens. Necrosis in this scenario may represent a lack of treatment effect or a therapeutic response to chemotherapy. This study sought to validate the histologic classification of necrosis into 2 types: usual necrosis (UN) representing an absence of treatment effect, and infarct-like necrosis (ILN) representing a therapeutic response to chemotherapy. Tumor regression grade (TRG) is a previously described prognosticating method that estimates tumor replacement by fibrosis. We incorporated ILN into a modified TRG (mTRG) and compared its performance as a prognostic factor against TRG. A retrospective clinical and histologic review was undertaken of all partial hepatectomies performed for colorectal liver metastases at our center between 2004 and 2010. Clinicopathologic features were compared between the 2 types of necrosis, including survival stratified by TRG and mTRG. A total of 109 cases were reviewed, with 46 patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy. ILN was identified in 12 cases, and all of these cases were associated with perioperative chemotherapy. ILN was significantly associated with perioperative treatment with bevacizumab. In patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy, those with ILN had superior disease-free survival compared with those with UN (P=0.047). mTRG1 to 2 scores were associated with significantly better survival compared with mTRG3 to 5 scores. In contrast, use of TRG did not demonstrate a significant difference in disease-free and overall survival. ILN represents a form of treatment effect and should be distinguished from UN. A modified grading system that incorporates ILN may enhance the prognostic utility of TRG.}

However, overfitting is a significant issue in conventional radiomics, where a large number of radiomic features are directly used to train and test models that predict genotypes or clinical outcomes. In order to tackle this problem, we propose an unsupervised learning pipeline composed of an autoencoder for representation learning of radiomic features and a Gaussian mixture model based on minimum message length criterion for clustering. By incorporating probabilistic modeling, disease heterogeneity has been taken into account. The performance of the proposed pipeline was evaluated on an institutional MRI cohort of 108 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases. Our approach is capable of automatically selecting the optimal number of clusters and assigns patients into clusters (imaging subtypes) with significantly different survival rates. Our method outperforms other unsupervised clustering methods that have been used for radiomics analysis and has comparable performance to a state-of-the-art imaging biomarker.},

Patients and Methods                                A total of 172 lesions selected by RECIST were evaluated in 40 patients with metastatic GISTs treated with imatinib. All patients had pretreatment and 2-month follow-up CTs and FDG-PETs. Multivariate analysis was performed using tumor size and density (Hounsfield unit [HU]) on CT and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV                 max                 ) on FDG-PET. Patients were observed up to 28 months.                                                        Results                                Mean baseline tumor size and density on CT were 5.3 cm and 72.8 HU, respectively, and mean baseline SUV                 max                 on FDG-PET was 5.8. Thirty-three patients had good response on FDG-PET. A decrease in tumor size of more than 10\% or a decrease in tumor density of more than 15\% on CT had a sensitivity of 97\% and a specificity of 100\% in identifying PET responders versus 52\% and 100\% by RECIST. Good responders on CT at 2 months had significantly longer time to progression than those who did not respond (P = .01).                                                        Conclusion               Small changes in tumor size or density on CT are sensitive and specific methods of assessing the response of GISTs. If the prognostic value of our proposed CT response criteria can be confirmed prospectively, the criteria should be employed in future studies of patients with GIST.},

In this review, we describe the unique microenvironment encountered by cancer cells in the liver, focusing on elements of the innate and adaptive immune response that can act as a double-edge sword, contributing to the elimination of cancer cells on the one hand and promoting their survival and growth, on the other. We discuss this microenvironment in a clinical context, particularly for colorectal carcinoma, and highlight how a better understanding of the role of the microenvironment has spurred an intense effort to develop novel and innovative strategies for targeting liver metastatic disease, some of which are currently being tested in the clinic.},

  abstract = {Abstract                                           The PDLIM2 protein regulates stability of transcription factors including NF-{$\kappa$}B and STATs in epithelial and hemopoietic cells. PDLIM2 is strongly expressed in certain cancer cell lines that exhibit an epithelial-to-mesenchymal phenotype, and its suppression is sufficient to reverse this phenotype. PDLIM2 supports the epithelial polarity of nontransformed breast cells, suggesting distinct roles in tumor suppression and oncogenesis. To better understand its overall function, we investigated PDLIM2 expression and activity in breast cancer. PDLIM2 protein was present in 60\% of tumors diagnosed as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and only 20\% of other breast cancer subtypes. High PDLIM2 expression in TNBC was positively correlated with adhesion signaling and {$\beta$}-catenin activity. Interestingly, PDLIM2 was restricted to the cytoplasm/membrane of TNBC cells and excluded from the nucleus. In breast cell lines, PDLIM2 retention in the cytoplasm was controlled by cell adhesion, and translocation to the nucleus was stimulated by insulin-like growth factor-1 or TGF{$\beta$}. Cytoplasmic PDLIM2 was associated with active {$\beta$}-catenin and ectopic expression of PDLIM2 was sufficient to increase {$\beta$}-catenin levels and its transcriptional activity in reporter assays. Suppression of PDLIM2 inhibited tumor growth in vivo, whereas overexpression of PDLIM2 disrupted growth in 3D cultures. These results suggest that PDLIM2 may serve as a predictive biomarker for a large subset of TNBC whose phenotype depends on adhesion-regulated {$\beta$}-catenin activity and which may be amenable to therapies that target these pathways.                                         Significance:               This study shows that PDLIM2 expression defines a subset of triple-negative breast cancer that may benefit from targeting the {$\beta$}-catenin and adhesion signaling pathways.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Radiomics is a noninvasive method using machine learning to support personalised medicine. Preprocessing filters such as wavelet and Laplacian-of-Gaussian filters are commonly used being thought to increase predictive performance. However, the use of preprocessing filters increases the number of features by up to an order of magnitude and can produce many correlated features. Both substantially increase the dataset complexity, which in turn makes modeling with machine learning techniques more challenging, possibly leading to poorer performance. We investigated the impact of these filters on predictive performance.                                         Methods               Using seven publicly available radiomic datasets, we measured the impact of adding features preprocessed with eight different preprocessing filters to the unprocessed features on the predictive performance of radiomic models. Modeling was performed using five feature selection methods and five classifiers, while predictive performance was measured using area-under-the-curve at receiver operating characteristics analysis (AUC-ROC) with nested, stratified 10-fold cross-validation.                                         Results                                Significant improvements of up to 0.08 in AUC-ROC were observed when all image preprocessing filters were applied compared to using only the original features (up to                 p                 = 0.024). Decreases of -0.04 and -0.10 were observed on some data sets, but these were not statistically significant (                 p                 {$>$} 0.179). Tuning of the image preprocessing filters did not result in decreases in AUC-ROC but further improved results by up to 0.1; however, these improvements were not statistically significant (                 p                 {$>$} 0.086) except for one data set (                 p                 = 0.023).                                                        Conclusions               Preprocessing filters can have a significant impact on the predictive performance and should be used in radiomic studies.},

These approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration accuracy and are generally fast. However, deep learning (DL) approaches are, in contrast to conventional non-deep-learning-based approaches, anatomy-specific. Recently, a universal deep registration approach, uniGradICON, has been proposed. However, uniGradICON focuses on monomodal image registration. In this work, we therefore develop multiGradICON as a first step towards universal *multimodal* medical image registration. Specifically, we show that 1) we can train a DL registration model that is suitable for monomodal *and* multimodal registration; 2) loss function randomization can increase multimodal registration accuracy; and 3) training a model with multimodal data helps multimodal generalization.

Here, we systematically quantify the capsule's extent and cellular composition in 263 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases to investigate its clinical significance and origin. We show that survival improves proportionally with increasing encapsulation and decreasing tumor-hepatocyte contact. Immunostaining reveals the gradual zonation of the capsule, transitioning from benign-like NGFRhigh stroma at the liver edge to FAPhigh stroma towards the tumor. Encapsulation correlates with decreased tumor viability and preoperative chemotherapy. In mice, chemotherapy and tumor cell ablation induce capsule formation. Our results suggest that encapsulation develops where tumor invasion into the liver plates stalls, representing a reparative process rather than tumor-induced desmoplasia. We propose a model of metastases growth, where the efficient tumor colonization of the liver parenchyma and a reparative liver injury reaction are opposing determinants of metastasis aggressiveness.},

Methods               The statistical reliability of radiomic features was assessed retrospectively in three clinical datasets (patient numbers: 108 head and neck cancer, 37 small-cell lung cancer, 47 non-small-cell lung cancer). Features were calculated using four platforms (PyRadiomics, LIFEx, CERR and IBEX). PyRadiomics, LIFEx and CERR are IBSI-compliant, whereas IBEX is not. The effects of IBSI compliance, user-defined calculation settings and platform version were assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients and confidence intervals. The influence of platform choice on the relationship between radiomic biomarkers and survival was evaluated using univariable cox regression in the largest dataset.                                         Results               The reliability of radiomic features calculated by the different software platforms was only excellent (ICC {$>$} 0.9) for 4/17 radiomic features when comparing all four platforms. Reliability improved to ICC {$>$} 0.9 for 15/17 radiomic features when analysis was restricted to the three IBSI-compliant platforms. Failure to harmonise calculation settings resulted in poor reliability, even across the IBSI-compliant platforms. Software platform version also had a marked effect on feature reliability in CERR and LIFEx. Features identified as having significant relationship to survival varied between platforms, as did the direction of hazard ratios.

Key Points                                {$\bullet$} Reliability of radiomic features varies between feature calculation platforms and with choice of software version.                                               {$\bullet$} Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI) compliance improves reliability of radiomic features across platforms, but only when calculation settings are harmonised.                                               {$\bullet$} IBSI compliance, user-defined calculation settings and choice of platform version collectively affect the prognostic value of features.},

  abstract  = {One of the most common cancers worldwide, colorectal cancer (CRC) has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality and therefore represents an enormous burden to the health care system. Recent advances in CRC treatments have provided patients with primary and metastatic CRC a better long-term prognosis. The presence of synchronous or metachronous metastasis has been associated, however, with worse survival. The most common site of metastatic disease is the liver. A variety of treatment modalities aimed at targeting colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has been demonstrated to improve the prognosis of these patients. Loco-regional approaches such as surgical resection and tumor ablation (operative and percutaneous) can provide patients with a chance at long-term disease control and even cure in select populations. Patient selection is important in defining the most suitable treatment option for CRLM in order to provide the best possible survival benefit while avoiding unnecessary interventions and adverse events. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in evaluating the characteristics of CRLMs and disease resectability. Size of tumors, proximity to adjacent anatomical structures, and volume of the unaffected liver are among the most important imaging parameters to determine the suitability of patients for surgical management or other appropriate treatment approaches. We herein provide a comprehensive overview of current-state-of-the-art imaging in the management of CRLM, including staging, treatment planning, response and survival assessment, and post-treatment surveillance. Computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are two most commonly used techniques, which can be used solely or in combination with functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Providing up-to-date evidence on advantages and disadvantages of imaging modalities and tumor assessment criteria, the current review offers a practice guide to assist providers in choosing the most suitable imaging approach for patients with CRLM.},

To address this issue we employed multispectral (MS) analysis using the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T(2), proton density (M(0)), and k-means (KM) clustering algorithm to identify multiple compartments within both viable and necrotic tissue in a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) tumor model receiving single-dose (1000 cGy) radiotherapy. Optimization of the KM method was achieved through histological validation by hematoxylin-eosin (H\& and E) staining and hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) immunohistochemistry. The optimum KM method was determined to be a two-feature (ADC, T(2)) and four-cluster (two clusters each of viable tissue and necrosis) segmentation. KM volume estimates for both viable (r = 0.94, P {$<$} 0.01) and necrotic (r = 0.69, P = 0.07) tissue were highly correlated with their H\&E counterparts. HIF-1alpha immunohistochemistry showed that the intensity of HIF-1alpha expression tended to be concentrated in perinecrotic regions, supporting the subdivision of the viable tissue into well-oxygenated and hypoxic regions. Since both necrosis and hypoxia have been implicated in poor treatment response and reduced patient survival, the ability to quantify the degree of necrosis and the severity of hypoxia with this method may aid in the planning and modification of treatment regimens.}

The authors analyzed clinical data from a large number of patients with histologically confirmed, distant-stage adenocarcinoma to evaluate metastatic patterns.                                         METHODS               Tumor registry data were collected between 1994-1996 on 11 primary tumor sites and 15 metastatic sites from 4399 patients. The primary and metastatic sites were cross-tabulated in various ways to identify patterns, and the authors developed algorithms by using multinomial logistic regression analysis to predict the locations of primary tumors based on metastatic patterns.                                         RESULTS               Three primary tumors had single, dominant metastatic sites: ovary to abdominal cavity (91\%), prostate to bone (90\%), and pancreas to liver (85\%). The liver was the dominant metastatic site for gastrointestinal (GI) primary tumors (71\% of patients), whereas bone and lung metastases were noted most frequently in non-GI primary tumors (43\% and 29\%, respectively). In a study of combinations of liver, abdominal cavity, and bone metastases, 86\% of prostate primary tumors had only bone metastases, 80\% of ovarian primary tumors had only abdominal cavity metastases, and 74\% of pancreas primary tumors had only liver metastases. A single organ was the dominant source of metastases in 7 sites: axillary lymph node from the breast (97\%), intestinal lymph node from the colon (84\%), thoracic lymph node from the lung (66\%), brain from the lung (64\%), mediastinal lymph node from the lung (62\%), supraclavicular lymph node from the breast (51\%), and adrenal gland from the lung (51\%).                                         CONCLUSIONS               The algorithms that the authors developed achieved a cross-validated accuracy of 64\% and an accuracy of 64\% on an 1851-patient independent test set, compared with 9\% accuracy when a random classifier was used.

The authors developed algorithms for predicting the location of primary tumors based on these distinct metastatic patterns and achieved 64\% accuracy, compared with 9\% accuracy when a random classifier was used.},

  abstract  = {PURPOSE: Radiological evaluation of the efficacy of preoperative chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) is the most important tool for determining treatment strategies. The aim of this study was to identify a correlation between morphologic appearance on computed tomography (CT) and histologic findings of CRLM after preoperative chemotherapy. METHODS: We examined 47 patients who had undergone a first hepatic resection for CRLM after preoperative chemotherapy and had received contrast-enhanced CT scans. We assessed the morphologic appearance of the overall attenuation based on metastases changing from heterogeneous to mixed and homogenous lesions, the tumor-liver interface, and the peripheral rim enhancement on CT. Histologic parameters included usual necrosis (UN), infarct-like necrosis (ILN), three-zonal change, dangerous halo, mucous lake, shape of ILN, dominant type of necrosis, and presence of viable tumor cells. The relationship between morphologic appearance and histologic findings was evaluated. RESULTS: CT overall attenuation revealed that UN predominance was more common in the heterogeneous group than in the mixed and homogeneous groups (P = 0.011). The frequency of ILN increased sequentially from ill-defined to variable and sharp at the tumor-liver interface (P = 0.038), and the frequency of UN decreased sequentially from present to partially resolved and completely resolved in the peripheral rim enhancement (P = 0.023). The histologic presence of viable tumor cells was closely associated with the tumor-liver interface (P = 0.0003) and the peripheral rim enhancement (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: CT morphologic appearance of CRLM after preoperative chemotherapy is correlated with histologic findings regarding necrosis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                                           It is well-recognized that solid tumors are genomically, anatomically, and physiologically heterogeneous. In general, more heterogeneous tumors have poorer outcomes, likely due to the increased probability of harboring therapy-resistant cells and regions. It is hypothesized that the genomic and physiologic heterogeneity are related, because physiologically distinct regions will exert variable selection pressures leading to the outgrowth of clones with variable genomic/proteomic profiles. To investigate this, methods must be in place to interrogate and define, at the microscopic scale, the cytotypes that exist within physiologically distinct subregions (``habitats'') that are present at mesoscopic scales. MRI provides a noninvasive approach to interrogate physiologically distinct local environments, due to the biophysical principles that govern MRI signal generation. Here, we interrogate different physiologic parameters, such as perfusion, cell density, and edema, using multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Signals from six different acquisition schema were combined voxel-by-voxel into four clusters identified using a Gaussian mixture model. These were compared with histologic and IHC characterizations of sections that were coregistered using MRI-guided 3D printed tumor molds. Specifically, we identified a specific set of MRI parameters to classify viable-normoxic, viable-hypoxic, nonviable-hypoxic, and nonviable-normoxic tissue types within orthotopic 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumors. This is the first coregistered study to show that mpMRI can be used to define physiologically distinct tumor habitats within breast tumor models.                                         Significance:               This study demonstrates that noninvasive imaging metrics can be used to distinguish subregions within heterogeneous tumors with histopathologic correlation.},

Only robust and stable features should be used in prognostication/prediction models to improve generalizability across multiple institutions. In this study, we investigated the repeatability and reproducibility of radiomic features with respect to three different scanners, variable slice thickness, tube current, and use of intravenous (IV) contrast medium, combining phantom studies and human subjects with non-small cell lung cancer. In all, half of the radiomic features showed good repeatability (ICC\,{$>$}\,0.9) independent of scanner model. Within acquisition protocols, changes in slice thickness was associated with poorer reproducibility compared to the use of IV contrast. Broad feature classes exhibit different behaviors, with only few features appearing to be the most stable. 108 features presented both good repeatability and reproducibility in all the experiments, most of them being wavelet and Laplacian of Gaussian features.},

  abstract   = {PURPOSE: We aimed to precisely estimate intra-tumoral heterogeneity using spatially regularized spectral clustering (SRSC) on multiparametric MRI data and compare the efficacy of SRSC with the previously reported segmentation techniques in MRI studies. PROCEDURES: Six NMRI nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous human glioblastoma U87 MG tumors were scanned using a dedicated small animal 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The data consisted of T2 weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient maps, and pre- and post-contrast T2 and T2* maps. Following each scan, the tumors were excised into 2-3-mm thin slices parallel to the axial field of view and processed for histological staining. The MRI data were segmented using SRSC, K-means, fuzzy C-means, and Gaussian mixture modeling to estimate the fractional population of necrotic, peri-necrotic, and viable regions and validated with the fractional population obtained from histology. RESULTS: While the aforementioned methods overestimated peri-necrotic and underestimated viable fractions, SRSC accurately predicted the fractional population of all three tumor tissue types and exhibited strong correlations (rnecrotic~=~0.92, rperi-necrotic~=~0.82 and rviable~=~0.98) with the histology. CONCLUSIONS: The precise identification of necrotic, peri-necrotic and viable areas using SRSC may greatly assist in cancer treatment planning and add a new dimension to MRI-guided tumor biopsy procedures.},

Methods               Gibbs-ringing is a well-known artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp image gradients at tissue boundaries. The origin can be seen in the truncation of k-space during MRI data-acquisition. Correction techniques like Gegenbauer reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these missing data. Here, we present a simple and robust method which exploits a different view on the Gibbs-phenomenon: The truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a convolution of the underlying image with a sinc-function. As the image is reconstructed on a discretized grid, the severity of the ringing artifacts depends on how this grid is located with respect to the edge and the oscillation pattern of the function. We propose to reinterpolate the image based on local, subvoxel-shifts to sample the ringing pattern at the zero-crossings of the oscillating sinc-function.                                         Results               With the proposed method, the artifact can simply, effectively, and robustly be removed with a minimal amount of image smoothing.                                         Conclusions               The robustness of the method suggests it as a suitable candidate for an implementation in the standard image processing pipeline in clinical routine.

Sponsored by the Radiological Society of North America, an interdisciplinary group of radiologists, statisticians, physicists, and other researchers worked to develop a comprehensive terminology to serve as a foundation for quantitative imaging biomarker claims. Where possible, this working group adapted existing definitions derived from national or international standards bodies rather than invent new definitions for these terms. This terminology also serves as a foundation for the design of studies that evaluate the technical performance of quantitative imaging biomarkers and for studies of algorithms that generate the quantitative imaging biomarkers from clinical scans. This paper provides examples of research studies and quantitative imaging biomarker claims that use terminology consistent with these definitions as well as examples of the rampant confusion in this emerging field. We provide recommendations for appropriate use of quantitative imaging biomarker terminological concepts. It is hoped that this document will assist researchers and regulatory reviewers who examine quantitative imaging biomarkers and will also inform regulatory guidance. More consistent and correct use of terminology could advance regulatory science, improve clinical research, and provide better care for patients who undergo imaging studies.},

Since then, numerous studies have applied these guidelines, have further substantiated the potential clinical value of the HGPs in patients with liver metastases from various tumour types and are starting to shed light on the biology of the distinct HGPs. In the present guidelines, we give an overview of these studies, discuss novel strategies for predicting the HGPs of liver metastases, such as deep-learning algorithms for whole-slide histopathology images and medical imaging, and highlight liver metastasis animal models that exhibit features of the different HGPs. Based on a pooled analysis of large cohorts of patients with liver-metastatic colorectal cancer, we propose a new cut-off to categorise patients according to the HGPs. An up-to-date standard method for HGP assessment within liver metastases is also presented with the aim of incorporating HGPs into the decision-making processes surrounding the treatment of patients with liver-metastatic cancer. Finally, we propose hypotheses on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive the biology of the different HGPs, opening some exciting preclinical and clinical research perspectives.}

  abstract   = {Abstract             The success of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is deeply rooted in the powerful concept that during their random, diffusion-driven displacements molecules probe tissue structure at a microscopic scale well beyond the usual image resolution. As diffusion is truly a three-dimensional process, molecular mobility in tissues may be anisotropic, as in brain white matter. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion anisotropy effects can be fully extracted, characterized, and exploited, providing even more exquisite details on tissue microstructure. The most advanced application is certainly that of fiber tracking in the brain, which, in combination with functional MRI, might open a window on the important issue of connectivity. DTI has also been used to demonstrate subtle abnormalities in a variety of diseases (including stroke, multiple sclerosis, dyslexia, and schizophrenia) and is currently becoming part of many routine clinical protocols. The aim of this article is to review the concepts behind DTI and to present potential applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:534--546. \copyright{} 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

To accurately measure intra-tumoral heterogeneity, a non-invasive imaging technique, known as habitat imaging, was developed. The technique quantifies intra-tumoral heterogeneity by dividing complex tumors into distinct sub- regions, called habitats. This article reviews the following aspects of habitat imaging in cancer treatment, with a focus on radiotherapy: (1) Habitat imaging biomarkers for assessing tumor physiology; (2) Methods for habitat generation; (3) Efforts to combine radiomics, another imaging quantification method, with habitat imaging; (4) Technical challenges and potential solutions related to habitat imaging; (5) Pathological validation of habitat imaging and how it can be utilized to evaluate cancer treatment by predicting treatment response including survival rate, recurrence, and pathological response as well as ongoing open clinical trials.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: The FOLFOXIRI regimen produces a high rate of radiological and histopathological responses. Bevacizumab added to chemotherapy showed an improvement in pathological response and necrosis of colorectal liver metastases (CLMs). FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab produced promising early clinical results and is under investigation in several randomised trials, although no data are currently available on its effects on response of CLMs and on liver toxicities. METHODS: Starting from 499 patients enrolled in first-line phase II/III trials, we selected on the basis of tissue sample availability 18 patients treated with FOLFOXIRI/XELOXIRI and 24 patients treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab who underwent secondary resection of CLMs. The 28 untreated patients who underwent primary resection of CLMs were included as control group. Responses of CLMs and chemotherapy-induced toxicities were assessed. RESULTS: Among the patients, 63\% of those treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab, as compared with 28\% of those treated with only FOLFOXIRI/XELOXIRI, showed a histopathological response (P=0.033). In the two groups, 52\% and 12.5\%, respectively, showed necrosis {$\geq$}50\% (P=0.017). The incidence of liver toxicities was not significantly increased in patients treated with FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab. CONCLUSION: The addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOXIRI produces high rates of pathologic responses and necrosis of CLM without increasing liver toxicity.},

  abstract  = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Nowadays many treatments are available to help control CRC, including surgery, radiation therapy, interventional radiology, and drug treatments. A multidisciplinary approach and the role of radiologists is needed to assist the surgeon in the management thanks to emerging technology and strategies. The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) has been created to objectify and standardize cancer response assessment. Thus, in this article specific presumptions and practical aspects of evaluating responses according to the RECIST 1.1 are discussed. Furthermore, examples of possible response to systemic treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), including tumour necrosis, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, tumour calcification, tumour fibrosis and intratumoural fat deposition observed on cross-sectional imaging, are described. Disappearing liver metastases (DLM) presents a therapeutic dilemma. The optimal management of DLM remains controversial due to the uncertainty of residual microscopic disease and effective long-term outcomes. The article provides an overview of the CRLM phenomenon and current possible assessment methods of the response to systemic treatment.},

  abstract   = {Objective               Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. The geographical and temporal burden of this cancer provides insights into risk factor prevalence and progress in cancer control strategies. We examine the current and future burden of CRC in 185 countries in 2020 and 2040.                                         Methods               Data on CRC cases and deaths were extracted from the GLOBOCAN database for the year 2020. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex, country, world region and Human Development Index (HDI) for 185 countries. Age-specific rates were also estimated. The predicted number of cases and deaths in 2040 were calculated based on global demographic projections by HDI.                                         Results               Over 1.9\,million new CRC cases and 930\,000 deaths were estimated in 2020. Incidence rates were highest in Australia/ New Zealand and European regions (40.6 per 100 000, males) and lowest in several African regions and Southern Asia (4.4 per 100 000, females). Similar patterns were observed for mortality rates, with the highest observed in Eastern Europe (20.2 per 100 000, males) and the lowest in Southern Asia (2.5 per 100 000, females). The burden of CRC is projected to increase to 3.2\,million new cases and 1.6\,million deaths by 2040 with most cases predicted to occur in high or very high HDI countries.                                         Conclusions               CRC is a highly frequent cancer worldwide, and largely preventable through changes in modifiable risk factors, alongside the detection and removal of precancerous lesions. With increasing rates in transitioning countries and younger adults, there is a pressing need to better understand and act on findings to avert future cases and deaths from the disease.},

METHODS               ASCO convened an Expert Panel to conduct a systematic review of relevant studies and develop recommendations for clinical practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS               Doublet chemotherapy should be offered, or triplet therapy may be offered to patients with previously untreated, initially unresectable mCRC, on the basis of included studies of chemotherapy in combination with anti--vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies. In the first-line setting, pembrolizumab is recommended for patients with mCRC and microsatellite instability-high or deficient mismatch repair tumors; chemotherapy and anti--epidermal growth factor receptor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair left-sided treatment-naive RAS wild-type mCRC; chemotherapy and anti--vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is recommended for microsatellite stable or proficient mismatch repair RAS wild-type right-sided mCRC. Encorafenib plus cetuximab is recommended for patients with previously treated BRAF V600E--mutant mCRC that has progressed after at least one previous line of therapy. Cytoreductive surgery plus systemic chemotherapy may be recommended for selected patients with colorectal peritoneal metastases; however, the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is not recommended. Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be recommended following systemic therapy for patients with oligometastases of the liver who are not considered candidates for resection. Selective internal radiation therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with unilobar or bilobar metastases of the liver. Perioperative chemotherapy or surgery alone should be offered to patients with mCRC who are candidates for potentially curative resection of liver metastases. Multidisciplinary team management and shared decision making are recommended. Qualifying statements with further details related to implementation of guideline recommendations are also included.

Well-established automatic methods for quantitative imaging offer the opportunity to enrich the radiologist interpretation with a large number of radiomic features, which need to be highly reproducible to be used reliably in clinical practice. This study investigates feature reproducibility against noise, varying resolutions and segmentations (achieved by perturbing the regions of interest), in a CT dataset with heterogeneous voxel size of 98 renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and 93 contralateral normal kidneys (CK). In particular, first order (FO) and second order texture features based on both 2D and 3D grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCMs) were considered. Moreover, this study carries out a comparative analysis of three of the most commonly used interpolation methods, which need to be selected before any resampling procedure. Results showed that the Lanczos interpolation is the most effective at preserving original information in resampling, where the median slice resolution coupled with the native slice spacing allows the best reproducibility, with 94.6\% and 87.7\% of features, in RCC and CK, respectively. GLCMs show their maximum reproducibility when used at short distances.},

Given the widespread use of antiangiogenic agents in CRC, there has been considerable interest in the development of methods to identify novel markers that can predict outcome in the treatment of this disease with angiogenesis inhibitors. Multiple biomarkers are in various phases of development and include tissue, serum, and imaging biomarkers. The complexity of the angiogenesis pathway and the overlap between the various angiogenic factors present a significant challenge to biomarker discovery. In our review, we discuss the angiogenesis pathway and the most promising evolving concepts in biomarker discovery, as well as highlight the landmark studies that identify subgroups of patients with CRC who may preferentially benefit from angiogenesis inhibitors.},

  abstract   = {Although cancer often is referred to as ``a disease of the genes,'' it is indisputable that the (epi)genetic properties of individual cancer cells are highly variable, even within the same tumor. Hence, preexisting resistant clones will emerge and proliferate after therapeutic selection that targets sensitive clones. Herein, the authors propose that quantitative image analytics, known as ``radiomics,'' can be used to quantify and characterize this heterogeneity. Virtually every patient with cancer is imaged radiologically. Radiomics is predicated on the beliefs that these images reflect underlying pathophysiologies, and that they can be converted into mineable data for improved diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and therapy monitoring. In the last decade, the radiomics of cancer has grown from a few laboratories to a worldwide enterprise. During this growth, radiomics has established a convention, wherein a large set of annotated image features (1-2000 features) are extracted from segmented regions of interest and used to build classifier models to separate individual patients into their appropriate class (eg, indolent vs aggressive disease). An extension of this conventional radiomics is the application of ``deep learning,'' wherein convolutional neural networks can be used to detect the most informative regions and features without human intervention. A further extension of radiomics involves automatically segmenting informative subregions (``habitats'') within tumors, which can be linked to underlying tumor pathophysiology. The goal of the radiomics enterprise is to provide informed decision support for the practice of precision oncology.           ,              Virtually every patient with cancer is radiologically imaged. The field of radiomics combines quantitative analysis of these images with machine learning to improve diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, and therapy monitoring. This review describes radiomics including novel artificial intelligence methods, and introduces the practice of defining subregions, or ``habitats,'' within tumors.},

  abstract   = {Objective assessment of tumor responses and treatment results has been the basis for the advancement of cancer therapies, and imaging plays a key role to provide a ``common language'' to describe the results of cancer treatment. Although Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) has been the most widely accepted method for assessing tumor response in the past decades, the limitations of RECIST have increasingly becoming recognized, especially with the recent advances of precision-medicine approaches to cancer. This article reviews the current concept of tumor response evaluations based on RECIST, describes the limitations of RECIST, and proposes strategies to overcome the limitations. The article emphasizes specific limitations in the setting of precision cancer therapy and cancer immunotherapy and discusses the important insights provided by the cutting-edge investigations in the emerging fields.           ,              PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS             RECIST1.1 is the current version of tumor response criteria that are widely accepted as a standardized method in most trials of solid tumors in general; it uses unidimensional diameters of target lesions and the sum of measurements of all target lesions as a quantitative measure of tumor burden. Major limitations of RECIST that universally affect the response assessment regardless of tumor types or agents include variability of tumor size measurements and tumoral heterogeneity both within a lesion and among different lesions in a patient. Among the specific limitations of RECIST in precision cancer therapy, in patients treated with molecular targeting agents with antiangiogenic activity, decrease of CT tumor density may reflect response to therapy even without tumor size decrease meeting the criteria for RECIST response; Choi criteria can contribute to address the pitfall. In patients with tumors harboring specific genomic abnormalities treated with effective molecular targeting therapy, tumors tend to show marked initial response and then slowly grow back while the patients are receiving therapy, where RECIST progression does not necessarily indicate treatment failure and the tumor growth rate may contribute to help therapeutic decisions. In patients treated with cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade, atypical response patterns or pseudoprogression, although rare, can be noted, and several criteria have been proposed to address the unmet needs in the emerging field.},

  abstract  = {INTRODUCTION: The computed tomography (CT) morphology after chemotherapy is reportedly correlated with the histopathologic response to chemotherapy and a better surgical outcome in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). However, the true prognostic advantage of CT morphology remains uncertain. METHODS: The prognostic advantage of CT morphology was validated in 86 patients who underwent surgical resection for CLM after undergoing a 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy regimen with or without bevacizumab. RESULTS: An optimal morphologic response was observed in 18 (22.8\%) patients, and a strong correlation between the CT morphology and tumor viability was confirmed (P {$<$} 0.001). A multivariate analysis revealed that bevacizumab (odds ratio [OR], 6.8; P = 0.03) and chemotherapy cycles {$\geq$}6 (OR, 3.6; P = 0.04) were associated with an optimal morphologic response. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were also predicted by CT morphology with a higher sensitivity. Particularly, a group 1 morphology was associated with a higher OS rate (3-year OS 100\%) and RFS rate (3-year RFS, 57.0\%), and a multivariate analysis confirmed that group 2 and group 3 tumor morphology was a significant predictive factor for tumor recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 2.5; P = 0.03 and HR, 3.2; P {$<$} 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: The CT morphology of CLM predicts tumor viability and long-term surgical outcomes after chemotherapy.}

At the same time, model-based approaches are also increasingly incorporated into advanced MRI acquisition and reconstruction techniques. However, after about two decades of intellectual and financial investment, microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow progress in clinical translation may signify unresolved fundamental problems. We outline such problems and related practical pitfalls, as well as review strategies for developing and validating tissue microstructure models, to provoke a discussion on how to bridge the gap between our scientific aspirations and the clinical reality. We argue for recalibrating the efforts of our community toward a more systematic focus on fundamental research aimed at identifying relevant degrees of freedom affecting the measured MR signal. Such a focus is essential for realizing the truly revolutionary potential of noninvasive three-dimensional in vivo microstructural mapping.},

  abstract   = {Abstract               Tumors exhibit genomic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which has prognostic significance and may influence response to therapy. Imaging can quantify the spatial variation in architecture and function of individual tumors through quantifying basic biophysical parameters such as CT density or MRI signal relaxation rate; through measurements of blood flow, hypoxia, metabolism, cell death, and other phenotypic features; and through mapping the spatial distribution of biochemical pathways and cell signaling networks using PET, MRI, and other emerging molecular imaging techniques. These methods can establish whether one tumor is more or less heterogeneous than another and can identify subregions with differing biology. In this article, we review the image analysis methods currently used to quantify spatial heterogeneity within tumors. We discuss how analysis of intratumor heterogeneity can provide benefit over more simple biomarkers such as tumor size and average function. We consider how imaging methods can be integrated with genomic and pathology data, instead of being developed in isolation. Finally, we identify the challenges that must be overcome before measurements of intratumoral heterogeneity can be used routinely to guide patient care.

Foundation models are generally trained using self-supervised learning and excel in reducing the demand for training samples in downstream applications. This is especially important in medicine, where large labelled datasets are often scarce. Here, we developed a foundation model for cancer imaging biomarker discovery by training a convolutional encoder through self-supervised learning using a comprehensive dataset of 11,467 radiographic lesions. The foundation model was evaluated in distinct and clinically relevant applications of cancer imaging-based biomarkers. We found that it facilitated better and more efficient learning of imaging biomarkers and yielded task-specific models that significantly outperformed conventional supervised and other state-of-the-art pretrained implementations on downstream tasks, especially when training dataset sizes were very limited. Furthermore, the foundation model was more stable to input variations and showed strong associations with underlying biology. Our results demonstrate the tremendous potential of foundation models in discovering new imaging biomarkers that may extend to other clinical use cases and can accelerate the widespread translation of imaging biomarkers into clinical settings.},

Here, we developed CT-FM, a large-scale 3D image-based pre-trained model designed explicitly for various radiological tasks. CT-FM was pre-trained using 148,000 computed tomography (CT) scans from the Imaging Data Commons through label-agnostic contrastive learning. We evaluated CT-FM across four categories of tasks, namely, whole-body and tumor segmentation, head CT triage, medical image retrieval, and semantic understanding, showing superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Beyond quantitative success, CT-FM demonstrated the ability to cluster regions anatomically and identify similar anatomical and structural concepts across scans. Furthermore, it remained robust across test-retest settings and indicated reasonable salient regions attached to its embeddings. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale medical imaging foundation models and by open-sourcing the model weights, code, and data, aims to support more adaptable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions in radiology.},

Such models, typically referred to as foundation models (FMs), are trained on extensive corpora of unlabeled data and demonstrate high performance across various tasks. FMs have recently received extensive attention from academic, industry, and regulatory bodies. Given the potentially transformative impact that FMs can have on the field of radiology, radiologists must be aware of potential pathways to train these radiology-specific FMs, including understanding both the benefits and challenges. Thus, this review aims to explain the fundamental concepts and terms of FMs in radiology, with a specific focus on the requirements of training data, model training paradigms, model capabilities, and evaluation strategies. Overall, the goal of this review is to unify technical advances and clinical needs for safe and responsible training of FMs in radiology to ultimately benefit patients, providers, and radiologists.             \copyright{} RSNA, 2025},

  abstract  = {With the development of chemotherapy regimens, targeted therapies, and hepatic surgery, the survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has dramatically improved. Imaging plays a central role for the diagnosis, staging, and treatment allocation in these patients. To interpret CRLM on imaging, radiologists must be familiar with the main imaging features of untreated tumors as well as the modifications induced by systemic therapies, and their meaning in relation to pathological tumor response and tumor biology. CRLM have the same histological features as the primary tumor. Most are "non-otherwise specified" (NOS) adenocarcinomas. The mucinous tumor is the most common of the rare subtypes. In NOS tumors, imaging usually differentiates central areas of necrosis from peripheral proliferating tumors and desmoplastic reaction. Areas of mucin mixed with fibrosis are seen in mucinous subtypes to help differentiate the metastases from other tumors cysts or hemangiomas. After treatment, the viable tumor is gradually replaced by ischemic-like necrosis and fibrosis, and remnants cells are mainly located on the periphery of tumors. Imaging can help predict the degree of tumor response, but changes can be difficult to differentiate from the pretherapeutic appearance. When chemotherapy is interrupted or in case of resistance to treatment, a peripheral infiltrating halo of tumor growth may appear. The purpose of the article is to illustrate the significance of the imaging features of colorectal liver metastases during systemic therapy, using radiopathological correlations.},

Resection of CRLM may provide cure and improves survival over chemotherapy alone. However, resectability of CLRM has to be decided in multidisciplinary tumor boards and is based on oncological factors, technical factors and patient factors. The advances of chemotherapy lead to the abolition of contraindications to resection in favor of technical resectability, but somatic mutations and molecular subtyping may improve selection of patients for resection in the future. Technical factors center around anatomy of the lesions, volume of the remnant liver and quality of the liver parenchymal. Multiple strategies have been developed to overcome volume limitations and they are reviewed here. The least investigated topic is how to select the right patients among an elderly and frail patient population for the large variety of technical options specifically for bi-lobar CRLM to keep 90-day mortality as low as possible. The review is an overview over the current state-of-the art and a systematic guide to the topic of resectability of CRLM for both clinicians and patients.},

Every 3~years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC occurrence based on incidence data (available through 2016) from population-based cancer registries and mortality data (through 2017) from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, approximately 147,950 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from the disease, including 17,930 cases and 3,640 deaths in individuals aged younger than 50~years. The incidence rate during 2012 through 2016 ranged from 30 (per 100,000 persons) in Asian/Pacific Islanders to 45.7 in blacks and 89 in Alaska Natives. Rapid declines in incidence among screening-aged individuals during the 2000s continued during 2011 through 2016 in those aged 65~years and older (by 3.3\% annually) but reversed in those aged 50 to 64~years, among whom rates increased by 1\% annually. Among individuals aged younger than 50~years, the incidence rate increased by approximately 2\% annually for tumors in the proximal and distal colon, as well as the rectum, driven by trends in non-Hispanic whites. CRC death rates during 2008 through 2017 declined by 3\% annually in individuals aged 65~years and older and by 0.6\% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64~years while increasing by 1.3\% annually in those aged younger than 50~years. Mortality declines among individuals aged 50~years and older were steepest among blacks, who also had the only decreasing trend among those aged younger than 50~years, and excluded American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates remained stable. Progress against CRC can be accelerated by increasing access to guideline-recommended screening and high-quality treatment, particularly among Alaska Natives, and elucidating causes for rising incidence in young and middle-aged adults.},

However, this progress is increasingly confined to older adults. CRC occurrence has been on the rise in patients younger than age 50, often referred to as early-onset disease, since the mid-1990s. Young patients are more often diagnosed at an advanced stage and with rectal disease than their older counterparts, and they have numerous other unique challenges across the cancer management continuum. For example, young patients are less likely than older patients to have a usual source of health care; often need a more complex treatment protocol to preserve fertility and sexual function; are at higher risk of long-term and late effects, including subsequent primary malignancies; and more often suffer medical financial hardship. Diagnosis is often delayed because of provider- and patient-related factors, and clinicians must have a high index of suspicion if young patients present with rectal bleeding or changes in bowel habits. Educating primary care providers and the larger population on the increasing incidence and characteristic symptoms is paramount. Morbidity can further be averted by increasing awareness of the criteria for early screening, which include a family history of CRC or polyps and a genetic predisposition.},

Treatment selection for patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) is difficult; although hepatic resection will cure a minority of CRLM patients, recurrence is common. Reliable preoperative prediction of recurrence could therefore be a valuable tool for physicians in selecting the best candidates for hepatic resection in the treatment of CRLM. It has been hypothesized that evidence for recurrence could be found via quantitative image analysis on preoperative CT imaging of the future liver remnant before resection. To investigate this hypothesis, we have collected preoperative hepatic CT scans, clinicopathologic data, and recurrence/survival data, from a large, single-institution series of patients (n\,=\,197) who underwent hepatic resection of CRLM. For each patient, we also created segmentations of the liver, vessels, tumors, and future liver remnant. The largest of its kind, this dataset is a resource that may aid in the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers and machine learning models for the prediction of post-resection hepatic recurrence of CRLM.},

  abstract  = {Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs) has been has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). However, the slide representations resulting from this approach are highly tailored to specific clinical tasks, which limits their expressivity and generalization, particularly in scenarios with limited data. Instead, we hypothesize that morphological redundancy in tissue can be leveraged to build a task-agnostic slide representation in an unsupervised fashion. To this end, we introduce PANTHER, a prototype-based approach rooted in the Gaussian mixture model that summarizes the set of WSI patches into a much smaller set of morphological prototypes. Specifically, each patch is assumed to have been generated from a mixture distribution, where each mixture component represents a morphological exemplar. Utilizing the estimated mixture parameters, we then construct a compact slide representation that can be readily used for a wide range of downstream tasks. By performing an extensive evaluation of PANTHER on subtyping and survival tasks using 13 datasets, we show that 1) PANTHER outperforms or is on par with supervised MIL baselines and 2) the analysis of morphological prototypes brings new qualitative and quantitative insights into model interpretability.},

  abstract  = {Although angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the growth of most human solid tumours, alternative mechanisms of vascularisation can be adopted. We have previously described a non-angiogenic growth pattern in liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) in which tumour cells replace hepatocytes at the tumour-liver interface, preserving the liver architecture and co-opting the sinusoidal blood vessels. The aim of this study was to determine whether this replacement pattern occurs during liver metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas (BC) and whether the lack of an angiogenic switch in such metastases is due to the absence of hypoxia and subsequent vascular fibrinogen leakage. The growth pattern of 45 BC liver metastases and 28 CRC liver metastases (73 consecutive patients) was assessed on haematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue sections. The majority of the BC liver metastases had a replacement growth pattern (96\%), in contrast to only 32\% of the CRC metastases (P{$<$}0.0001). The median carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression (M75 antibody), as a marker of hypoxia, (intensity x \% of stained tumour cells) was 0 in the BC metastases and 53 in the CRC metastases (P{$<$}0.0001). There was CA9 expression at the tumour-liver interface in only 16\% of the BC liver metastases vs 54\% of the CRC metastases (P=0.002). There was fibrin (T2G1 antibody) at the tumour-liver interface in only 21\% of the BC metastases vs 56\% of the CRC metastases (P=0.04). The median macrophage count (Chalkley morphometry; KP-1 anti-CD68 antibody) at the interface was 4.3 and 7.5, respectively (P{$<$}0.0001). Carbonic anhydrase 9 score and macrophage count were positively correlated (r=0.42; P=0.002) in all metastases. Glandular differentiation was less in the BC liver metastases: 80\% had less than 10\% gland formation vs only 7\% of the CRC metastases (P{$<$}0.0001). The liver is a densely vascularised organ and can host metastases that exploit this environment by replacing the hepatocytes and co-opting the vasculature. Our findings confirm that a non-angiogenic pattern of liver metastasis indeed occurs in BC, that this pattern of replacement growth is even more prevalent than in CRC, and that the process induces neither hypoxia nor vascular leakage.}

This framework identifies three PET/CT subtypes, which maintain prognostic value after adjusting for clinicopathologic risk factors including tumor volume. Additionally, these subtypes complement ctDNA in predicting disease recurrence. Radiogenomics analysis unveil the molecular underpinnings of these imaging subtypes, highlighting downregulation in interferon alpha and gamma pathways in the high-risk subtype. In summary, our study demonstrates that these habitat imaging subtypes effectively stratify NSCLC patients based on their risk levels for disease recurrence after initial curative surgery or radiotherapy, providing valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches.},

  abstract  = {PURPOSE: Histopathologic patterns at the invasion fronts of tumors predict metastatic potential and prognosis in several cancers. We examined whether such patterns at the interface between colorectal liver metastases and hepatic parenchyma have similar prognostic value. METHODS: Microscopic growth patterns at edges of metastases including desmoplasia, pushing borders, and replacement of hepatocytes were retrospectively analyzed with respect to surgical outcomes in 142 patients who underwent hepatectomy for colorectal metastases. RESULTS: Patterns included desmoplasia in 58 patients (41\%), hepatocyte replacement in 41 (29\%), and pushing borders in 43 (30\%). Maximum metastasis diameter and serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration in patients showing desmoplastic tumor growth were lower than those in others (P {$<$} 0.05 and P {$<$} 0.01). Disease-free survival and overall survival were better in patients showing desmoplastic growth, while a non-desmoplastic tumor growth pattern showed a negative influence. More cluster of differentiation (CD) 68-positive M1 macrophages and fewer CD206-positive M2 macrophages were demonstrated at interfaces of tumors with hepatic parenchyma when desmoplasia was present, although markers for proliferative activity (MIB1 index) and metastatic potential (E-cadherin expression) appeared uninfluenced by desmoplasia. CONCLUSION: Better long-term results were associated with metastatic tumors showing desmoplastic growth patterns at invasion fronts, which may reflect local immune state in a prognostically useful manner.},

Methods:               29 consecutive patients with meningioma (59.0 \textpm{} 16.8 years old, 8 males and 21 females) who underwent a subsequent surgical resection were examined with both IVIM imaging and a histopathological analysis. IVIM imaging was conducted using a single-shot SE-EPI sequence with 13 b-factors (0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 100, 200, 300, 400, 600, 800, 1000 s mm- ~2) at 3T. The perfusion fraction (f) was calculated by fitting the IVIM bi-exponential model. The 90-percentile f-value in the tumor region-of-interest (ROI) was defined as the maximum f-value (f-max). Histopathological vascular density (\%Vessel) was measured on CD31-immunostainted histopathological specimens. The correlation and agreement between the f-values and \%Vessel was assessed.                                         Results:               The f-max (15.5 \textpm{} 5.5\%) showed excellent agreement [intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) = 0.754] and a significant correlation (r = 0.69, p \&lt; 0.0001) with the \%Vessel (12.9 \textpm{} 9.4\%) of the tumors. The Bland-Altman plot analysis showed excellent agreement between the f-max and \%Vessel (bias, -2.6\%; 95\% limits of agreement, from -16.0 to 10.8\%). The f-max was not significantly different among the histological subtypes of meningioma.                                         Conclusion:               An excellent agreement and a significant correlation were observed between the f-values and \%Vessel. The f-value can be used as a noninvasive quantitative imaging measure to directly assess the vascular volume fraction in brain tumors.                                         Advances in knowledge:               The f-value measured by IVIM imaging showed a significant correlation and an excellent agreement with the histological vascular density in the meningiomas. The f-value can be used as a noninvasive and quantitative imaging measure to directly assess the volume fraction of capillaries in brain tumors.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The liver is the most common site of metastasis in patients with colorectal cancer due to its anatomical situation regarding its portal circulation. About 14 to 18\% of patients with colorectal cancer present metastasis at the first medical consultation, and 10 to 25\% at the time of the resection of the primary colorectal cancer. The incidence is higher (35\%) when a computed tomography (CT) scan is used.             In the last decades, a significant increase in the life expectancy of patients with colorectal cancer has been achieved with different diagnostic and treatment programs. Despite these improvements, the presence of metastasis, disease recurrence, and advanced local tumors continue to remain poor prognostic factors.             Median survival without treatment is {$<$}8 months from the moment of its presentation, and a survival rate at 5 years of 11\% is the best prognosis for those who present with local metastasis. Even in patients with limited metastatic disease, 5-year survival is exceptional. Patients with hepatic metastasis of colorectal cancer have a median survival of 5 to 20 months with no treatment. Approximately 20 to 30\% of patients with colorectal metastasis have disease confined to the liver, and this can be managed with surgery. Modern surgical strategies at the main hepatobiliary centers have proved that hepatectomy of 70\% of the liver can be performed, with a mortality rate of {$<$}5\%.             It is very important to have knowledge of predisposing factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment of hepatic metastasis. However, the establishment of newer, efficient, preventive screening programs for early diagnosis and adequate treatment is vital.

  abstract  = {The liver is host to many metastatic cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, for which the last 2 decades have seen major advances in diagnosis and treatment. The liver is a vital organ, and the extent of its involvement with metastatic disease is a major determinant of survival. Metastatic cells arriving in the liver via the bloodstream encounter the microenvironment of the hepatic sinusoid. The interactions of the tumor cells with hepatic sinusoidal and extrasinusoidal cells (endothelial, Kupffer, stellate, and inflammatory cells) determine their fate. The sinusoidal cells can have a dual role, sometimes fatal to the tumor cells but also facilitatory to their survival and growth. Adhesion molecules participate in these interactions and may affect their outcome. Bone marrow-derived cells and chemokines also play a part in the early battle for survival of the metastases. Once the tumor cells have arrested and survived the initial onslaught, tumors can grow within the liver in 3 distinct patterns, reflecting differing host responses, mechanisms of vascularization, and proteolytic activity. This review aims to present current knowledge of the interactions between the host liver cells and the invading metastases that has implications for the clinical course of the disease and the response to treatment.}

Radiomic artificial intelligence (AI) technology, either based on engineered hard-coded algorithms or deep learning methods, can be used to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers. However, lack of standardized algorithm definitions and image processing severely hampers reproducibility and comparability of results. To address this issue, we developed PyRadiomics, a flexible open-source platform capable of extracting a large panel of engineered features from medical images. PyRadiomics is implemented in Python and can be used standalone or using 3D Slicer. Here, we discuss the workflow and architecture of PyRadiomics and demonstrate its application in characterizing lung lesions. Source code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at www.radiomics.io. With this platform, we aim to establish a reference standard for radiomic analyses, provide a tested and maintained resource, and to grow the community of radiomic developers addressing critical needs in cancer research.

The pooled overall survival hazard ratio (HR) for all included studies was 1.77 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.62--1.93). Patients with breast cancer primaries fared the worst (HR, 2.37; 95\% CI, 1.64--3.44), as did patients treated with immunotherapies (HR, 1.86; 95\% CI, 1.42--2.42).

Personalising therapy for this tumour requires non-invasive tools to visualise its heterogeneity to monitor treatment response on a regional level. To date, efforts to characterise glioblastoma's imaging features and heterogeneity have focussed on individual imaging biomarkers, or high-throughput radiomic approaches that consider a vast number of imaging variables across the tumour as a whole. Habitat imaging is a novel approach to cancer imaging that identifies tumour regions or 'habitats' based on shared imaging characteristics, usually defined using multiple imaging biomarkers. Habitat imaging reflects the evolution of imaging biomarkers and offers spatially preserved assessment of tumour physiological processes such perfusion and cellularity. This allows for regional assessment of treatment response to facilitate personalised therapy. In this review, we explore different methodologies to derive imaging habitats in glioblastoma, strategies to overcome its technical challenges, contrast experiences to other cancers, and describe potential clinical applications.},

How the necrotic core promotes metastasis remains unclear. Here, we report that emergence of necrosis inside the tumor is correlated temporally with increased tumor dissemination in a rat breast cancer model and in human breast cancer patients. By performing spatially focused transcriptional profiling, we identified angiopoietin-like 7 (Angptl7) as a tumor-specific factor localized to the perinecrotic zone. Functional studies showed that Angptl7 loss normalizes central necrosis, perinecrotic dilated vessels, metastasis, and reduces circulating tumor cell counts to nearly zero. Mechanistically, Angptl7 promotes vascular permeability and supports vascular remodeling in the perinecrotic zone. Taken together, these findings show that breast tumors actively produce factors controlling central necrosis formation and metastatic dissemination from the tumor core.},

Both repeatability and reproducibility constitute the reliability of a QIB measurement. In this article, we review the statistical aspects of repeatability and reproducibility of QIB measurements by introducing methods and metrics for assessments of QIB repeatability and reproducibility and illustrating the impact of QIB measurement error on sample size and statistical power calculations, as well as predictive performance with a QIB as a predictive biomarker.},

  abstract   = {Abstract               Assessing the response to oncological treatments is paramount for determining the prognosis and defining the best treatment for each patient. Several biomarkers, including imaging, can be used, but standardization is fundamental for consistency and reliability. Tumor response evaluation criteria have been defined by international groups for application in pharmaceutical clinical trials evaluating new drugs or therapeutic strategies. RECIST 1.1 criteria are exclusively based on unidimensional lesion measurements; changes in tumor size are used as surrogate imaging biomarkers to correlate with patient outcomes. However, increased tumor size does not always reflect tumor progression. The introduction of immunotherapy has led to the development of new criteria (iRECIST, Level of Evidence (LoE) Ib) that consider the possibility that an increase in disease burden is secondary to the immune response instead of progression, with the new concept of Unconfirmed Progressive Disease (a first progression event which must be confirmed on follow-up). Specific criteria were devised for HCC (mRECIST, LoE IV), which measure only enhancing HCC portions to account for changes after local therapy. For GIST treated with imatinib, criteria were developed to account for the possible increase in size reflecting a response rather than a progression by assessing both tumor size and density on CT (Choi, LoE II). This article provides concise and relevant practice recommendations aimed at general radiologists to help choose and apply the most appropriate criteria for assessing response to treatment in different oncologic scenarios. Though these criteria were developed for clinical trials, they may be applied in clinical practice as a guide for day-to-day interpretation.

However, the incremental change in survival for metastatic CRC patients not treated on trial has not yet been quantified. We performed a retrospective review of 1420 patients with               de novo               metastatic CRC who received their primary treatment at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) from 2004 through 2019. Median OS was roughly stable for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 (22.6 months) but since has steadily improved for those diagnosed in 2013 to 2015 (28.8 months), and 2016 to 2019 (32.4 months). Likewise, 5-year survival rate has increased from 15.7\% for patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2006 to 26\% for those diagnosed from 2013 to 2015. Notably, survival improved for patients with               BRAF                                V600E                              mutant as well as microsatellite unstable (MSI-H) tumors.

Radiomic models that only include robust features can be used to analyse new images, whereas models with non-robust features may fail to predict the outcome of interest accurately. Test-retest imaging is recommended to assess robustness, but may not be available for the phenotype of interest. We therefore investigated 18 combinations of image perturbations to determine feature robustness, based on noise addition (N), translation (T), rotation (R), volume growth/shrinkage (V) and supervoxel-based contour randomisation (C). Test-retest and perturbation robustness were compared for combined total of 4032 morphological, statistical and texture features that were computed from the gross tumour volume in two cohorts with computed tomography imaging: I) 31 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients; II): 19 head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Robustness was determined using the 95\% confidence interval (CI) of the intraclass correlation coefficient (1, 1). Features with CI\,{$\geq$}\,0:90 were considered robust. The NTCV, TCV, RNCV and RCV perturbation chain produced similar results and identified the fewest false positive robust features (NSCLC: 0.2--0.9\%; HNSCC: 1.7--1.9\%). Thus, these perturbation chains may be used as an alternative to test-retest imaging to assess feature robustness.},
